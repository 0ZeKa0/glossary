# Cloud Native Glossary

Please write a glossary definition with the following format for the terms you signed up for on [this sheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AP8Ts4e6o9GTA_df406f0ceruSLKSmd1uahf1NfsB3I/edit#gid=1925947464)  (1) what it is, (2) problem it addresses, and (3) how it helps.  Each section shouldn't exceed 100 words (a total of 300 words max per term).
Prior to our next meeting, please review what your peers have written, so we can decide what works best and how to tweak entries so they are all consistent. While writing, feel free to have a look at what others do to "borrow" good ideas and add comments to things you'd like to discuss during our meeting. 
*If a term is missing, it's because we copied and pasted after you added it, so feel free to add it below.

## Persona for this glossary: "101 persona" 

Content for anyone interested in cloud native concepts but with little to no previous tech knowledge. From the CEO who's suddenly in regular meetings with their CIO to discuss a migration of mission critical systems to a cloud native architecture to the new marketing or sales rep joining a cloud native startup who needs to get up to speed. 
At this stage, they all just need to understand what the tech is and what role it plays in the ecosystem. Due to their lack of previous knowledge, they'll benefit from examples that make these abstract tech concepts more concrete (e.g. machine >> your laptop, orchestrator >> OS, network >> the internet, scalability >> Netflix each Friday evening).

## Business impact of cloud native defined

Business operating models in todayâ€™s world have shifted dramatically. The ability to adjust to changing customer demands, technology stacks across supply chains, mergers and divestitures, and manage people dynamically are all contributing toward a move toward becoming Digital.  Digital transformation has now led to a world where organizations largely derive value and revenue through digital interactions.No longer is technology merely supporting business processes, it has become a strategic differentiator. 

Cloud native technologies allow companies to deliver digital products and services to market faster with increased scalability, stability, and resiliency to adapt as market needs shift while minimizing operations cost. loud native technologies automate operations to improve efficiency, elastically scale based on customer needs, and ensure business continuity.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining a community and ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects which focus on driving business value. We are a neutral space for open collaboration and innovation that enables the creation of new billion-dollar markets.

# Cloud Native Glossary

The [CNCF](cncf.io) Cloud Native Glossary Project is intended to be used as a reference for common terms used when talking about cloud native applications. 

## Working with definitions

In order to make is easier to work on individual terms they've been moved into individual files in the [definitions](/definitions) folder. We're still working on creating a style guide so expect the yaml format to change in the future.

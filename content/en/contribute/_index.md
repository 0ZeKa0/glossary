The Cloud Native Glossary content is stored in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/cncf/glossary) where you'll find a list of [issues](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues), [PRs](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/pulls), and [discussions](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/discussions) about the glossary. Consider joining our monthly Glossary Working Group meetings if you want to contribute regularly. You can find meeting details in the [CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/). We look forward to meeting you there!

There are three ways you can contribute:

1) Propose new terms
2) Update existing ones 
3) Help translate the glossary


## Propose new terms
You can propose a new term for others to work on or create a new definition yourself. Either way, you'll start by creating an issue (note that you'll need a GitHub account to do this).

Below is a step-by-step guide for those not yet familiar with GitHub. **If you are a GitHub Pro**, please *do* have a quick look to make sure you use our issue templates, appropriate naming conventions, claim a PR on Slack (otherwise we may miss it), and where to find the file template. And please make sure to read the [Style Guide](https://glossary.cncf.io/style-guide/) before getting started — thank you! 

### Creating an issue
Go to the [Glossary GitHub repo](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues) issues and click on "new issue."

ADD IMAGE 1

You'll see a variety of templates. To propose a new term in English, select "English Language Glossary Request."

ADD IMAGE 2

Add the word you're suggesting and hit "submit new issue." If you're just proposing a new term, you're done! To work on it, follow the next steps.

ADD IMAGE 3

Please join the #glossary channel on the CNCF Slack and let @Catherine Paganini, @jmo, and @Seokho Son know that you've submitted an issue and would like to work on it. They'll assign the issue to you signaling to everyone else that the term is already taken.

Here you can see that the first three terms are available while the next term has been assigned to someone.

Note that you can only claim one term at a time. If you want to work on multiple terms, please finish one before claiming the next.

### Submitting a new term (creating a PR)

Before getting started, please read the [Style Guide](https://glossary.cncf.io/style-guide/) — it will help minimize backs and forth. As stated in the style guide, we highly recommend starting with a Google or Word doc. 

Once the term is ready to submit, go to content (under code)…

ADD IMAGE 5

…then "en" (or the language you are submitting for)…

ADD IMAGE 6

…and select  _TEMPLATE.md

ADD IMAGE 7

Copy the content…

ADD IMAGE 8

…and go back to the "en" folder. Hit "add file" and select "create new file."

ADD IMAGE 9

Add the term name in the URL (no capitalization and no space) and .md at the end (if you the preview doesn't work, you probably forgot to add .md). Now past the template content below. Copy and paste your definition into the file. Note that GitHub uses markdown to format the text (e.g., hyperlink, bold, italic). Please refer to this [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). To view how this will look like, go to "preview."

ADD IMAGE 10

Scroll down and name the new commit file when you are ready to submit. You are now about to commit the term to your own branch. Submitting a PR requires one more step. Hit "commit new file" and…

ADD IMAGE 11

…now you're creating an PR:

ADD IMAGE 12

You should now see your PR under "Pull requests."

ADD IMAGE 13

## Update an existing term
To update an existing term, you can either suggest a change via an issue or go ahead and update the term directly by submitting a pull request (PR).

### Request a change via an issue
If you want to flag a problem with a term but don't know how or want to fix it yourself, click on "report issue."

ADD IMAGE 14

This will directly open an issue. Please elaborate on which change is needed and why. Hit submit, and that's it. 

ADD IMAGE 15

### Update a term directly
To change a term directly, go to "edit this page." 

ADD IMAGE 16

This will open the term's GitHub page. Make your changes and submit a PR. Please refer to "submitting a new term" above for a detailed description (jump to the section that speaks about markdown).

## Help translate the glossary
To help translate the glossary into your native language, please join the #glossary-localizations channel on the CNCF Slack and let us know. You can either join an existing team or create a new one. Please also join our monthly Glossary Working Group meetings. You can find meeting details in the [CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/). We look forward to meeting you there!

Cloud computing offers CPU power, storage, and network capabilities over the internet, enabling scalable and flexible access to resources across global data centers. It spans private clouds, dedicated to single organizations for security and control, and public clouds, open for widespread use, optimizing cost and scalability.

## Problem it addresses

Traditionally, organizations needing more computing capacity had to choose between costly investments in new server facilities or upgrades to existing infrastructureâ€”a slow and resource-heavy process.

## How it helps

Cloud computing addresses this by enabling organizations to rent computing resources as needed, without the burden of managing physical infrastructure. This approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, it frees organizations to concentrate on their core business, eliminating delays and costs associated with setting up new infrastructure. Secondly, it provides the flexibility to [scale](https://github.com/ronitblenz/glossary/blob/cloud_computing/content/en/scalability.md) resources up or down based on demand, aligning infrastructure needs closely with business requirements. Thus, cloud computing offers a practical solution for organizations to access the amount of infrastructure they need, when they need it, without overcommitting resources.

Cloud computing is a method of providing computing resources such as CPU power, storage, and network capabilities via the internet. It allows users to leverage remote computing power located in distant data centers. There are two types: private cloud, dedicated to a single organization, and public cloud, open for general use.

## Problem it addresses

Historically, organizations looking to increase their computing capacity faced a dilemma: either invest in new facilities for their servers and networks or upgrade existing ones. This process was time-consuming and resource-intensive.

## How it helps

Cloud computing addresses this by enabling organizations to rent computing resources as needed, without the burden of managing physical infrastructure. This approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, it frees organizations to concentrate on their core business, eliminating delays and costs associated with setting up new infrastructure. Secondly, it provides the flexibility to [scale](https://github.com/ronitblenz/glossary/blob/cloud_computing/content/en/scalability.md) resources up or down based on demand, aligning infrastructure needs closely with business requirements. Thus, cloud computing offers a practical solution for organizations to access the amount of infrastructure they need, when they need it, without overcommitting resources.

## What it is

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method used to regulate access to systems and resources based on user roles within an organization. 
Each job function is associated with specific roles and permissions. 
For example, a member of the marketing team may be granted permission to view sales deals in the pipeline (*read* permission) but is restricted from making edits (*write* permission). 
Different permissions are assigned to roles in sales, marketing, and similar distinctions apply within engineering teams.

## Problem it addresses

Individually managing access permissions for multiple users across a variety of system resources and data can be a complex task. 
Each user typically requires access to a different set of specific resources. 
Let's consider an organization with 500 developers (users) and 300 resources with varying permission levels (read, write, and no access). 
The administrator must ensure that each user is granted the correct permissions for all 300 resources. 
RBAC simplifies this process by providing predefined access control based on role groups.


## How it helps

RBAC offers precise control over user permissions within software systems. 
Depending on their roles, team members can modify a section, view it exclusively, or be completely restricted from accessing it. 
This granular permission allocation enables team members with distinct roles to collaborate on the same system while minimizing security risks.

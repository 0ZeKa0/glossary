  Reliability is the property of a system to be responsive in the presence of failure.

  A system's responsiveness, that is, its ability to meet its service level objectives, is a function of load and failure. Increased presence of load or an increased presence of failure leads to a decrease of responsiveness.

  Reliability ensures a system is responsive in the presence of failure. However, Reliability does not ensure a system is responsive in the presence of load (See Scalability)

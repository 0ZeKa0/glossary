  Cloud native technologies are those that can be used to uphold the ‘promise of the cloud’, and leverage the benefits of cloud computing to their fullest. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation hosts a number of projects that were designed from the ground up to exploit the capabilities of cloud computing.

  There are often many downsides to traditional models of IT operation, some of which may be more prevalent than others. Traditional systems are: hard to scale; not fault-tolerant; not self-healing; inefficient due to poor utilisation of resources; the list goes on.

  The use of Cloud Native Technologies means that the desirable traits of cloud-native systems are easier to achieve. Rather than fighting against the new paradigm, Cloud Native Technologies are designed to work well in the cloud environment. Generally speaking they are automatable, self-healing, and scalable.

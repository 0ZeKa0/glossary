## Stateful (vs. Stateless) Applications

In a Kubernetes environment, stateful applications store state information generated from requests. To run, all pods within a stateful container must have a local volume of persistent storage. By contrast, stateless applications are containerized microservices that have a single function or service. They leverage a server to process requests, but the server doesn’t retain state information between requests, and different requests can be processed by different servers. They don’t require storage to run, because they don’t retain any data.
